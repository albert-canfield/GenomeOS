"""Each test is its own run, as far as the input tracer is concerned (2026-10-02, lane-tracer).

`genomeos/manifest.py` records every file opened under data/ from the moment it is imported, and
`save_result` reconciles a new registry result against what the open window holds. A pytest session is
one process, so without this fixture a window would span every test since the last `save_result`, and
a result written by one test would be answerable for a file a different test read. A window per test is
the scope that matches what a window means: the reads of one run.

The fixture reopens the window rather than switching the tracer off, so every test still runs with the
hook live and a test can open its own window inside this one.
